### About nodeblog.cloudapp.net

nodeblog.cloudapp.net is a community supported blog that is focused on running node on Windows Azure. Expect to find here anything related to that. 

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][] and runs on an extra-small instance of [Windows Azure][].

The content for this site is stored in a [git repository][] and we would love to see contributions.
