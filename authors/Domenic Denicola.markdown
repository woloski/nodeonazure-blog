I develop software and servers for the Nook at [Barnes & Noble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com), including desktop apps written in HTML5 and JavaScript, as well as Node.js services developed locally on Windows and deployed to the cloud. Outside of work, I enjoy taking part in the New York tech scene and contributing to the growing open-source ecosystem surrounding Node.js. And outside of computers, you'll usually find me rock climbing, reading some sci-fi, or enjoying everything the city has to offer.
